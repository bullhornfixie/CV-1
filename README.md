## About Me 

In college, I studied mechanical engineering for 2 years and landed apprenticeships with The British Touring Car Team and Maranello’s/Ferrari. Having spent hours in the conservatory as a kid, building Meccano cranes and cars, if there were components I could assemble to have a working model, I was all over it.

I discovered coding, whilst sharing an office with a Creative Director. He said you’re a logical guy, with an eye for design and good with numbers, ever thought about becoming a developer? I'm positive, 90% of my life explorations stem from serendipity. So, courtesy of Amazon I ordered a book called ‘Python in a day’ and loved it from the word go but lost interest with the book. 

Fast forward to 2020, I am running a company in financial services which I founded in 2015 with the £2,500 bonus I received from my winter season in Austria as a ski guide. My company had just landed the largest Fund Manager in the US as a client but found myself itching for a fresh challenge and new dimensions to my daily role. 

In pursuit of personal growth, I picked up my ‘Python in a day’ book again, which was a slow burner, and decided to take the leap into a full time course with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech). I am now a software engineer with canned enthusiasm and knowledge, seeking my big break into the world of development!

## Skills

### Communication 
My greatest lesson in the art of being a fantastic communicator was during my Skipper training, at the helm of a 42ft yacht in challenging Atlantic sailing conditions with a crew of 3. Every gybe, tack, captains log, change of course required communication between myself and the crew. I was taught communication needs to be frequent, clear, and concise. It stuck with me. 

[Makers Tech Test Review](https://github.com/bullhornfixie/tech-test2-WK10-Makers)
*Really great readme, I enjoyed reading it! You shared some really great context here, and the instructions on how to run it were clear ~ Makers Coach*

### Personable 
I'm able to quickly build rapport with people and engage on a personal level. As a developer, I feel comfortable speaking with stakeholders and have client-facing experience from previous roles where diluting technical jargon into client-friendly language became a skill in itself. 

### Ambitious
I once pitched solo to the Financial Director of Hugo Boss at their HQ in Camden to manage their group pension scheme. This was on the edge of my comfort zone and I made it to the final 3 considerations. 

### Self Starter 
In 2018, I wanted to live in Barcelona for the summer. I studied Spanish for three months, found an apartment, and then got on a plane. My apartment fell through hours after arriving and I stayed in a hotel with a social terrace for 2 nights to work out a plan B. Here, I made a group of local friends, managed to source a new apartment, found a co-working space to run my business, brought a bike, enrolled in Spanish night school and met a Spanish girlfriend...in 2 weeks! This gave me the confidence that I could be dropped in a foreign situation and make it work. 

### Cool Under Pressure
Whilst a ski guide in Kitzbuhel, Austria, I was hosting a tour with a group of guests and a heavy snow storm descended upon the mountain which caused all ski lifts to close. After 2 hours of seeking shelter in a restaurant, I chaperoned my 8 guests down the mountain and a family of 4 who became stranded. This was a test of critical thinking in an unexpected situation.

### Problem Solving 
In 2015, when I launched an outsourced paraplanning company in financial services, we handled large volumes of client data via email or Dropbox. I could see this was a) not secure and b) difficult to manage. All my other competitors were using this method and I needed an alternative solution which was low cost but offered the functionality needed. Eventually, I found a startup called Clinked who offered a client portal and they agreed to white label this for me on a start up price. I integrated this portal into the website and we quickly gained a competitive edge with larger clients who had concerns over secure data sharing - problem solved.
