## About Me 

Having spent hours in the conservatory as a kid, building Meccano cranes and cars, if there were components I could assemble to achieve a working model, I was all over it. Post school I studied mechanical engineering and secured apprenticeships with Ferrari and The British Touring Car Team. 

The next chapter was a 10 year career in financial services. In November 2020, I decided to rekindle my passion for engineering, design and problem solving and embarked on a 16-week intense course with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) in London. 

I graduated as a software engineer in March 2021 and now working with a software engineering studio in London, building high quality apps using the React Library. I found my niche in crafting bespoke React Components which were reusable across various projects and migrating legacy apps to this modern framework for improved performance and streamlined on-going maintenance. 

**Languages**: JavaScript, CSS, HTML <br>
**Libraries**: React, Three.js, Three Fiber <br>
**CMS**: Contentful <br>
**Databases**: PostgreSQL <br>

## Professional Development 

To expand upon my skillset as a React Front End Developer, I am currently learning Three.js which is a JavaScript library to create and display 3D animations. This can be used to create engaging web apps, computer games, or even used to visualise data. [Explore](https://3d-world-with-three-fiber.vercel.app/)


### Problem Solving 
When I launched an outsourced paraplanning company in financial services, we handled large volumes of client data via email or Dropbox. I could see this was a) not secure and b) difficult to manage. All my other competitors were using this method and I needed an alternative solution that was low cost but offered the functionality needed. Eventually, I found a startup called [Clinked](https://clinked.com/) who offered a client portal and they agreed to white label this for me on a startup price. I integrated this portal into the [website](https://1to1paraplanning.co.uk/) and we quickly gained a competitive edge with larger clients who had concerns over secure data sharing - problem solved. 

### Communication 
My greatest lesson in the art of being a fantastic communicator was during my Skipper training, at the helm of a 42ft yacht in challenging Atlantic sailing conditions with a crew of 3. Every gybe, tack, captain's log, change of course required communication between myself and the crew. I was taught communication needs to be frequent, clear, and concise. It stuck with me. 

[Makers Tech Test Review](https://github.com/bullhornfixie/tech-test2-WK10-Makers)<br>
*"Really great readme, I enjoyed reading it! You shared some really great context here, and the instructions on how to run it were clear"*

### Personable 
I'm able to quickly build rapport with people and engage on a personal level. As a developer, I feel comfortable speaking with stakeholders and have client-facing experience from previous roles where diluting technical jargon into client-friendly language became a skill in itself. 

### Ambitious
I once pitched to the Financial Director of Hugo Boss at their HQ in Camden to manage their group pension scheme. This was on the edge of my comfort zone and I managed to qualify into the final 3 considerations. 

### Self Starter 
In 2018, I made a daunting solo move to Barcelona. In two weeks, I sourced an apartment, met a group of friends, found a co-working space to run my business, enrolled in a language night school, and met a girlfriend. With no network in a foreign environment, I quickly established myself. 

### Critical Thinking
Whilst a ski guide in Kitzbuhel, Austria, I was hosting a tour with a group of guests and a heavy snowstorm descended upon the mountain which caused all ski lifts to close. After 2 hours of seeking shelter in a restaurant, I chaperoned my 8 guests down the mountain and a family of 4 who became stranded. Within minutes, I had to evaluate the safest route down the mountain based on several risk factors; group ability, minimum exposure to the elements, obstacles on each run such as narrow trails, moguls, and run gradient. Based on my intuition and logical thinking I managed to safely guide the group back to base. 

### Front End Development 
Previously starting a business on a tight budget meant the luxury of a professional developer/designer was absent. I taught myself CSS/HTML and built a commercially viable website on WordPress [1to1Paraplanning](https://1to1paraplanning.co.uk/). Makers Academy gave me the back-end tools I needed for a full-stack profile.
