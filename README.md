## About Me 

I discovered coding, whilst sharing an office with a Creative Director. He said you’re a logical guy, with an eye for design and good with numbers, ever thought about becoming a developer? 90% of my explorations stem from these moments of serendipity. So, I ordered a book called ‘Python in a day’ from Amazon and loved it from the word go!

In college, I studied mechanical engineering for 2 years and landed apprenticeships with The British Touring Car Team and Maranello’s/Ferrari. This chosen path out of school rooted from hours spent in the conservatory as a kid, building Meccano cranes and cars. If there were components I could assemble to build a working model, I was all over it! 

Fast forward to 2020, I am now running a company in financial services which I founded in 2015 with the £2,500 bonus I received from my winter season in Austria as a ski guide and resort representative. My company had just landed the largest US Fund Manager as a client but for me personally, I was itching for a fresh challenge and new dimensions to my daily role. 

In pursuit of personal growth and to build something cool, I picked up my ‘Python in a day’ book again, which was a slow burner, and decided to take the leap into a full time course with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech). I am now a software engineer with canned enthusiasm and knowledge seeking my big break into the world of development!

## Skills

### Communication 
My greatest lesson in the art of being a fantastic communicator was when I trained to be a Skipper. At the helm of a 42ft yacht in the 
Atlantic with a crew 4 in challenging sailing conditions. Every gybe, tack, captain's log, change of course required communication between myself and the crew. I was taught communication needs to be frequent and delivers the maximum amount of information in the fewest words. It stuck with me! 

[Makers Tech Test Review](https://github.com/bullhornfixie/tech-test2-WK10-Makers)
*Really great readme, I enjoyed reading it! You shared some really great context here, and the instructions on how to run it were clear ~ Makers Coach*

### Personable 
I'm able to quickly build rapport with people and engage on a personal level. As a portfolio manager, this was a key skill to have when sitting in front of new clients who could be investing over £1m. People have to like you and they have to trust you in a short space of time. 

## Self Starter 
In 2018, I wanted to live in Barcelona for the summer but didn't know anyone there. So I hired a Spanish teacher in England, found an apartment, and then got on a plane. My apartment fell through hours after arriving and I stayed in a hotel with a terrace for 2 nights to work out a plan B. Here, I made a group of friends, managed to source a new apartment, found a co-working space to run my business, brought a bike, enrolled in Spanish night school and met a Spanish girlfriend...in 2 weeks! This gave me the confidence that I could be dropped in a foreign situation and make it work.

### Problem Solving 
When I brought my first property, it transpired the partioning wall ajoining my bedroom and a neighbouring flat had 0 insulation and there was a constant inflow of noise from talking and their TV. On being quoted £5k to rectify with soundproofing, I decided to take matters in my own hands and do the job myself. After a lot of googling, I designed a soundproof wall by creating 6 panels with a sandwich structure. Each side used Gyproc plasterboard with a vinyl sheet filling. You cannot drill holes in the panels so the mesaurements and cutting had to be precise then sealed with soundproof glue. After engineering the wall and completing the job, it was professionally plastered and watertight from nosie leaks - problem solved for £500!
