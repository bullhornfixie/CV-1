## About Me 

Having spent hours in the conservatory as a kid, building Meccano cranes and cars, if there were components I could assemble to achieve a working model, I was all over it. Post school I studied mechanical engineering at college for 2 years and landed apprenticeships with The British Touring Car Team and Maranello’s/Ferrari thereafter.  

Fast forward to April 2015, I launched an outsourcing company in financial services with a modest £2,500 in savings which I had earnt from selling lift passes as a ski guide in Autstria that winter. In 2020, my company secured a contract with one of the largest global fund managers. However, on reaching this peak I found myself itching for a fresh challenge and new dimensions to my daily role. 

I discovered coding whilst sharing an office with a Creative Director. He said you’re a logical guy, with an eye for design and good with numbers, ever thought about becoming a developer? As an advocate of serendipity, I ordered a book from Amazon the following morning called ‘Python in a day’ (good name, wishful thinking) and loved it from the word go but lost interest with the book. 

In pursuit of personal growth and following a passion for design, engineering and problem solving, I took a leap from 10 years in financial services into the world of development. I was accepted for a 16 week intense course with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) in London and I am now a software engineer with canned enthusiasm and knowledge, seeking my first step onto my new career path!

I am currently progressing my skills in React, Node.js and MongoDB.

**Languages**: JavaScript, JSX, Ruby, JQuery, CSS, HTML <br>
**Frameworks**: React Native, Rails, AWS <br>
**Testing**: RSpec, Jasmine <br>
**Databases**: PostgreSQL <br>

## Skills

### Problem Solving 
When I launched an outsourced paraplanning company in financial services, we handled large volumes of client data via email or Dropbox. I could see this was a) not secure and b) difficult to manage. All my other competitors were using this method and I needed an alternative solution which was low cost but offered the functionality needed. Eventually, I found a startup called [Clinked](https://clinked.com/) who offered a client portal and they agreed to white label this for me on a start up price. I integrated this portal into the [website](https://1to1paraplanning.co.uk/) and we quickly gained a competitive edge with larger clients who had concerns over secure data sharing - problem solved. 

### Communication 
My greatest lesson in the art of being a fantastic communicator was during my Skipper training, at the helm of a 42ft yacht in challenging Atlantic sailing conditions with a crew of 3. Every gybe, tack, captains log, change of course required communication between myself and the crew. I was taught communication needs to be frequent, clear, and concise. It stuck with me. 

[Makers Tech Test Review](https://github.com/bullhornfixie/tech-test2-WK10-Makers)<br>
*"Really great readme, I enjoyed reading it! You shared some really great context here, and the instructions on how to run it were clear" 

### Personable 
I'm able to quickly build rapport with people and engage on a personal level. As a developer, I feel comfortable speaking with stakeholders and have client-facing experience from previous roles where diluting technical jargon into client-friendly language became a skill in itself. 

### Ambitious
I once pitched solo to the Financial Director of Hugo Boss at their HQ in Camden to manage their group pension scheme. This was on the edge of my comfort zone and I made it to the final 3 considerations. 

### Self Starter 
In 2018, I wanted to live in Barcelona for the summer. I studied Spanish for three months, found an apartment, and then got on a plane. My apartment fell through hours after arriving and I stayed in a hotel with a social terrace for 2 nights to work out a plan B. Here, I made a group of local friends, managed to source a new apartment, found a co-working space to run my business, brought a bike, enrolled in Spanish night school and met a Spanish girlfriend...in 2 weeks! This gave me the confidence that I could be dropped in a foreign environment and make it work. 

### Cool Under Pressure
Whilst a ski guide in Kitzbuhel, Austria, I was hosting a tour with a group of guests and a heavy snow storm descended upon the mountain which caused all ski lifts to close. After 2 hours of seeking shelter in a restaurant, I chaperoned my 8 guests down the mountain and a family of 4 who became stranded. This was a test of critical thinking in an unexpected situation.

### Front End Development 
Previously starting a business on a tight budget meant the luxury of a professional developer/designer was absent. I taught myself CSS/HTML and built a commercially viable website on WordPress [1to1Paraplanning](https://1to1paraplanning.co.uk/). Makers Academy gave me the back end tools I needed for a full stack profile.
