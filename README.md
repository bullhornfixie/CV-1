## Summary

I am an enthusiastic developer who graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) in March 2021. The syallabus encapuslates the skills modern employers are seeking in the next generation of tech talent - solid developement process, team work, creativity, strong debugging ability and emotional intellegence. 

My strongest skills are React, TDD, Ruby, JavaScript and currently enhancing my proficiency in JavaScript and SQL.  

Since 2004, Iâ€™ve enjoyed a successful career in financial services as a portfolio manager, financial planner and operations director. I am highly numerate and love working with figures, however, over the last few years, I found myself yearning for a new challenge and dimensions to my daily role.

Having graduated, I am excited for a new path in software engineering which offers a platform to turn concepts into reality through teamwork, design, problem solving and engineering - three disciplines that are rooted in me from my college years as a mechanical engineer. 

I am now looking for my first developer role and please and feel free to contact regarding any opportunities!
