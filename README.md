#### Who I Am
From an early age, I was a tinkerer. Whether it was a failing speaker, an unsynchoronised 1210 turntable, or misfiring kart engine, I would be hastily reaching for the
toolbox and lifting a panel to look inside and understand how it worked and whether I could fix it? I gained enjoyment from learning how the components interacted with one 
another, the satisfaction of identifying the fault and the tangibility of reassambling. When I left school my path gravitated towards engineering and during my 2 year course, 
I was fortunate enough to have internships with Ferrari and a British Touring Car Team. 

For the last 5 years, I have worked in financial services as a company director and technician for re-structuring investment and pension assets. Whilst earnings were increasing, my interest was declining and I found myself seeking a channel for creativity, design, and a platform which supports innovation and craft...make way for programming. Having initially tested the waters with Python in 2019, there was an early realisation that I had found a new path which met all of the above but also homed the mathematical and analytical side of my brain.

Having emerged from the Makers Academy bootcamp, I'm still enjoying the discovery of Ruby and what the language can do. I'm now looking for my first role as a Junior 
Developer and I hope to work with others who are ambassadors of clean code and smooth running engines.
